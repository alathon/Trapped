Sprite workflow:

1) Place sprite in Assets/Spritesheets.
2) In Unity, under the sprite select 'Multiple' sprite mode, and hit Sprite Editor.
3) In Sprite Editor, slice the sprite correctly (usually using a grid).
4) In Sprite Editor, position the Pivot as a custom pivot at the feet, for every sprite frame.
5) Drag one of each direction of the sprite into the scene.
6) For each direction, click on it and select 'Animation'. Create an idle and walking
animation. The idle animation is just the first frame of the walk, and the walking animation
uses sample-size 12, and the frames sequentially placed one after the other (Drag them from
the sprite in the Project).
7) Once done, right-click under Animation folder and create a new Animation Controller Override,
overriding Generic Movement. Give it all of the animations just created (4x idle, 4x walk).
8) Delete all but one of the directional sprites created, give it an Animator, set the animator
to the one you just created.
9) Give it a Rigidbody2D, BoxCollider2D (around feet only), PolyNav Agent and an
appropriate AI script.
10) Set Rigidbody2D to be Fixed Angle & Kinematic
11) Give it the Hitbox and HP Bar prefabs, and size the hitbox BoxCollider to encase the entire
sprite. Push the HP Bar somewhere just above the hitbox of the sprite.
12) Set appropriate PolyNav Agent values (f.ex Mass 25, stop distance 0.25, decel rate 0,
slow distance 0, rotate speed 10, max speed 1.15 - 1.5
